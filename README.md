# Bike-Sharing
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a Tableau story for the bike trip analysis to convince the investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 
## Results

A Tableau story was created for the bike trip analysis (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chinnu.muthu/viz/NYCCitiBike_16371917105710/AugustPeakHours?publish=yes). The following visualisations were made as part of the story.
- A dashboard was created using the Total Bike Riders count. The total riders were classified based on the Usertype and plotted in a pie chart *(Fig 1)*.

- The length of time that the bikes are checked out for all riders were visualized *(Fig 2)* . The "tripduration" on "Hour" was added to the Filters field.

 - The length of time that the bikes were checked out for each gender was also graphed *(Fig 3)*.

- The number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day was graphed as a heatmap *(Fig 4)*. It is evident from the plot that the number of bikes rented is highest on Thursdays, followed by Saturday and Friday and it gets busier in the morning from 7:00- 10:00 and in the evenings from 4:00-8:00.

- A heatmap was graphed that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype *(Fig 6)*.

## Summary
It is evident from the visualizations that there are more male riders than others. We can also infer from this analysis that Thursdays are the busiest for the business.
The following visualizations can be performed for a detailed analysis.
- Top Starting and Ending Locations by Gender
- Top Starting and Ending Locations by Customers
